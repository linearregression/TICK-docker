# TICK Stack

Run the complete TICK stack using this [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file.
By using docker-compose all four official TICK stack images are started and linked together.
To know more about the individual components see [this](https://influxdata.com/)


## Prerequistes

You need to have docker-compose installed on your machine.
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


## Usage

Start all the images as follows:

    # cd to desired version
    cd 1.0/
    # Start all images in the background
    docker-compose up -d

    Note: unset DOCKER_HOST because docker-compose uses this.

### Check that InfluxDB works:

Run this curl command, if no errors occur InfluxDB is running:

    curl http://localhost:8086/ping


#### The `influx` client

Use the built-in influx cli service:

    docker-compose run influxdb-cli

### Check that Telegraf works

By default, the Telegraf creates a `telegraf` database.
Check that InfluxDB has such a database in addition to the `_internal` database.

    docker-compose run influxdb-cli
    > show databases

### Check that Chronograf works

Access the Chronograf inteface, [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)

You will need to add the InfluxDB server.
Use these settings:

Host: influxdb
Port: 8086

No auth or SSL.


### Check Kapacitor works

First, run this curl command, if no errors occur Kapacitor is running:

    curl http://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/ping


Use the built-in kapacitor cli service:

    docker-compose run kapacitor-cli
    $ kapacitor list tasks

Confirm Kapacitor is subscribed to all databases in InfluxDB

    docker-compose run influxdb-cli
    > show subscriptions

## Supported Docker versions

This image is officially supported on Docker version 1.10.1 or newer.
